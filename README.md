This repo is a cleanup
of Deepmind DNC - Differential neural computer
Namely to help allow additional formats
and dyamaically optimize towards the data structure.


Objectives include:

Bio data for donars, against quality of life and supportive data.
Deep minds DNC is essentially an expansion of the Neural turing machine : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf
Whereby a RCNN Minmizes to Understand the pattern of a set of memory cells - attempting to create a network of both understanding the Base architecture of a Turing machine and then use memory space as a method to enhance prediction.
See examples such as : https://github.com/carpedm20/NTM-tensorflow

I found the implementation too strongly coupled to deep minds sonnet to be applicable to my current indended applications.
Not to mention the terrible code quality - Although this is mostly the fault of python.
